HappyNumbers
============

Quick little bit of code for fun to generate [happy numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number).

Written as a C# console application using MonoDevelop on Ubuntu, but builds and runs fine with MonoDevelop
on MacOS X and with Visual Studio 2010 (including Express) on Windows. The Tests project will require
[NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/) to build (probably already installed with MonoDevelop, but will be needed for Windows).
